# TeenNumberChecker
Checks if the entered numbers contain a teen.

We'll say that a number is "teen" if it is in the range 13 -19 (inclusive).

Write a method named hasTeen with 3 parameters of type int.

The method should return boolean and it needs to return true if one of the parameters is in range 13(inclusive) - 19 (inclusive). Otherwise return false.


Write another method named isTeen with 1 parameter of type int.

The method should return boolean and it needs to return true if the parameter is in range 13(inclusive) - 19 (inclusive). Otherwise return false.
